title: Swift Learning Notes  - Closure

## Closure Definition
*Closures are **self-contained blocks of functionality** that can be **passed around** and **used** in your code.*
- Closures are similar to blocks in C and Objective C
- Closures can **capture** and **store** **references** to ***any*** constants and variables *from the context in which they are defined*.
- Global and nested functions are special cases of closures,not all kinds of functions.
