title: Snapkit 3.x（Swift3）的语法变化
---

## 基于`Swift 3`的snapkit 3.x语法变化
- Find all snp_ and replace with snp.
- UILayoutGuide DSL style changed a lot. (self.topLayoutGuideBottom --> self.topLayoutGuide.snp.bottom)
- constraining edges to margins or vice versa via `make.edges.equalTo(other.snp.margins)`
- make.center.equalTo(0) now positions a view at 0,0 in it's superview rather than the center, use make.center.equalToSuperview instead.
- updateConstraints will throw a fatal error if it generates a new constraint that did not exist before. Instead use makeConstraints to add additional constraints.
