##思辨的态度
As Einstein famously is reported to have said (“No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong”), we can never know for sure that any hypothesis is absolutely correct; we can only validate that it is consistent with our observations.

To summarize, the actual formal notation is as follows:

• The lower bound for the execution time of an algorithm is classified as Ω(f(n)) and corresponds to the best-case scenario

• The upper bound for the execution time is classified as O(f(n)) and corresponds to the worst-case scenario
