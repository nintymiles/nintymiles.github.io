## Linux的发音及由来 - Wikipedia
Linux (pronounced /ˈlɪnəks/ lin-əks or, less frequently, /ˈlaɪnəks/ lyn-əks) is a Unix-like and mostly POSIX-compliant computer operating system (OS) assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on 5 October 1991 by Linus Torvalds.The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to describe the operating system, which has led to some controversy.
