## What is SVG?
An SVG is an **image** file. It is perfectly possible to only use it as an image file, the same way you would use other image formats, such as PNG or JPEG. 

But **SVG is more than an image**. It is **a structured document** containing *markup elements*, *text*, and *style* instructions. While other image formats tell the computer which color to draw at which point on the screen, SVG tells the computer how to rebuild the graphic from its component parts. 

### SVG Is XML (and Sometimes HTML)
The SVG code you view in your text editor looks an awful lot like HTML code—full of angle brackets and attributes—but a standalone SVG file is parsed as **an XML document**.
