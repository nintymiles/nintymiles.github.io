title:  Learning Notes - About Swift 2.3

## Swift 2.3 和 Swift 2.2.1在语法上应该是一致的
Swift 2.3 is a minor update from Swift 2.2.1. The primary difference between Swift 2.2.1 and Swift 2.3 is that it is intended to be paired with Apple’s macOS 10.12, iOS 10, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10 SDKs. It also updates the underlying LLVM and Clang versions to match with those in the Swift 3 compiler.

`Swift 2.3` 和 `Swift 2.2.1` 完全一致，也可以从 `linux` 发行版说明看出。

> Official binaries for Linux will be available shortly after the upgrade to the continuous integration system (which produces the binaries). Note that for Linux, Swift 2.2.1 and Swift 2.3 are **nearly identical**. This post will be updated once binaries are available.
