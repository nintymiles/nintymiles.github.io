# Swift 2.3

JUNE 12, 2016 Ted Kremenek
We are pleased to announce Swift 2.3!

Swift 2.3 is a minor update from Swift 2.2.1. The primary difference between Swift 2.2.1 and Swift 2.3 is that it is intended to be paired with Apple’s macOS 10.12, iOS 10, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10 SDKs. It also updates the underlying LLVM and Clang versions to match with those in the Swift 3 compiler.

Sources
Sources for Swift 2.3 are available in the swift-2.3-branch branch on GitHub.

Downloads
Apple (Xcode)
Swift 2.3 is available for free as part of Xcode 8.

> 从这些描述中可以看出Swift2.3是为了在iOS10和Mac OS 10.12中兼容Swift2的语法而产生。
