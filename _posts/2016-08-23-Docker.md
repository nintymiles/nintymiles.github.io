## What is Docker?
###PACKAGE YOUR APPLICATION INTO A STANDARDIZED UNIT FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.


###LIGHTWEIGHT
Containers running on a single machine share the same operating system kernel; they start instantly and use less RAM. Images are constructed from layered filesystems and share common files, making disk usage and image downloads much more efficient.

###OPEN
Docker containers are based on open standards, enabling containers to run on all major Linux distributions and on Microsoft Windows -- and on top of any infrastructure.

###SECURE BY DEFAULT
Containers isolate applications from one another and the underlying infrastructure, while providing an added layer of protection for the application.
